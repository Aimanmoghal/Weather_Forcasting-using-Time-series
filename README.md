 🌤️ Weather Forecasting Using Time Series

A simple project to predict weather conditions using past data with time series models.

 📌 Description

This project uses historical weather data to forecast future weather conditions such as temperature and humidity. It applies time series techniques and machine learning models (like XGBoost) to analyze patterns and make accurate predictions. The aim is to build a lightweight and efficient weather forecasting system using Python.

 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- XGBoost

 📁 Dataset

The dataset used (`cleaned_weather.csv`) contains historical weather records with features like:
- Date  
- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Wind Speed  
- Pressure

 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-forecasting-timeseries.git
   cd weather-forecasting-timeseries

	2.	Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Run the notebook:

jupyter notebook Weather_Forecast.ipynb



📊 Output
	•	Visual comparison of actual vs predicted values
	•	Forecast plots showing future trends
